* Sample dataset:
	* https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat462/node/101/
	* https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat462/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.stat462/files/data/poverty/index.txt
	* downloaded and cleaned into './poverty.csv'

* the file `metropolis-algorithm.py` is a basic implementation of the Metropolis Monte Carlo Markoc Chain algorithm. Essentially made in order to understand the algorithm.

* the file `pym3_testing.py` then uses a library to perform the MCMC.
